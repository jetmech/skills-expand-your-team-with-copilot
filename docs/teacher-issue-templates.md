## How These Templates Help

### For Teachers
- **No technical knowledge required** - Templates use plain language
- **Guided questions** ensure you don't forget important details
- **Clear examples** show exactly what information to provide
- **Priority levels** help communicate urgency appropriately

### For Technical Implementation
Each template collects the essential information needed for automated coding assistants:

1. **Clear problem description** - What needs to be changed and why
2. **Acceptance criteria** - How to know when the task is complete
3. **Implementation hints** - Technical suggestions and constraints
4. **Context and limitations** - Related information that affects the solution

## Example: Using the Feature Request Template

**Before templates:** "Can we limit how many students sign up for activities?"

**With template guidance:**
```
Feature Title: Add activity capacity limits
Problem: Chess Club only has 12 seats but unlimited students can register
Solution: Teachers set max participants, system prevents over-enrollment
Acceptance Criteria: 
- ‚úì Teachers can set capacity when creating activities
- ‚úì Registration disabled when full
- ‚úì Students see "Activity Full" message
User Stories:
- As a teacher, I want to set limits so I don't get overwhelmed
- As a student, I want to know if an activity is full before trying
```

This detailed information allows automated tools to implement the feature correctly without back-and-forth clarification.
